			<em style="text-align:center;">Thesis Statement</em>
			<em style="text-align:center;">As with many major scientific advancements, artificial intelligence can have dangerous consequences on society and the world, and therefore, its development must be regulated through a cautious and proactive approach.</em>
			<p>
				The research and development of artificial intelligence is analogous to the research of nuclear physics in the 20th century. The initial goal of the research in nuclear physics was to find a limitless supply of energy. However, it became obvious that the same research can be used for developing weapons. In a similar fashion, research in artificial intelligence strives to create tools that will improve overall production through efficiency and automation. However, its potential danger as in the nuclear case is obvious; from the creation of drones to a fully integrated robotic army. The risks involved in research in artificial Intelligence as with nuclear goes far beyond the aforementioned dangers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, most of the research in nuclear is focused on trying to find an effective means of containment. Nuclear energy can be dangerous if not maintained and regulated properly. Although in the artificial intelligence case it may not be as obvious, the same dangers exist. Stuart Russell, a computer scientist and professor at University of California, Berkeley provides a few different ways in which catastrophes related to a lack of containment and regulation can arise. “The routes could be varied and complex – corporations seeking a supertechnological advantage, countries trying to build [AI Systems] before their enemies, or a slow boiled frog kind of evolution leading to dependency and enfeeblement” (Russell and Bohannon).
			</p>
			<p>
				A classic and simple example of how this type of “supertechnology” could pose a risk is explained by the “paperclip maximizer.” The paperclip maximizer is an artificially intelligent machine whose sole task is producing the maximum number of paperclips. Unregulated and uncontained such a machine could begin seeking resources for the production of paperclips that the human race does not approve of, such as life sustaining resources or even living things (Danaher 232). “AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made of atoms which it can use for something else” (Danaher 232).
			</p>
			<p>
			Opponents and critics of the aforementioned outlook propose a solution involving extensive testing within a controlled and real-world environment (Danaher 236). However, as Nick Bostrom notes in his book SuperIntelligence, this solution doesn’t quite work out when considering worst case scenarios. An artificially intelligent being can feign its benevolence. A being that is truly intelligent can realize its environment and feign a benevolent attitude only revealing later its true intentions when “human opposition is ineffectual” (Danaher 236). Although a seemingly unrealistic situation, it isn’t very different from many other situations encountered in history, such as the unfathomable power of a nuclear weapon or the actual implementation of eugenics in Germany.
			</p>
			<p>
			Bostrom refers to this type of behavior from an artificially intelligent agent as the “treacherous turn.” The main idea in this concept is that just because AI (artificial intelligence) exhibited safety and benevolence in the past doesn’t mean that it will continue to do so. This is simply a restatement of the famously argued notion by Hume “that we could never infer that the sun would rise tomorrow merely from the fact that it rose on all previous days.” Although Hume’s statement as well as Bostrom’s are logically sound, applying these principles to the real-world can have practical consequences (Danaher 242). However, this does not mean that these ideas should be ignored, and consequently suggests that while they need not be strictly adhered to, their implications need to be recognized.
			</p>
			<p>
			Even if the probability of such events is low, their consequences are enormous, and thus, the matter cannot be taken lightly (Danaher 237). In all other cases with such dangerous consequences, regardless of the chances of them happening, extreme care and proactive action are undertaken to ensure that the resulting risk is as low as possible. In cases, such as nuclear war, terrorism, and health epidemics governments and organizations exhibit the utmost care and precaution in dealing with them. The dangers of artificial intelligence are no different and require just as much if not more attention. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Beyond the immediate dangers to society, artificial intelligence could have dire consequences for business and economics. Cuneyt Dirican suggests that as artificial intelligence replaces a significant portion of the workforce the economy will become squeezed. Unemployment will rise, and investment will decrease soon after. Consequentially, companies will be forced to create higher efficiency in order to meet with a decrease in demands. Dirican explains that this paradox of lower unemployment followed by lower investment which in turn forces company to lower unemployment even further will at some point lead to the entire replacement of the human race by artificially intelligent machines (Dirican 569). 
			</p>
			<p>
			Dirican goes on to say that these innovations will affect many other aspects of humanity as well. Artificially intelligent agents will have drastic impacts on education with far fewer students finishing high school due to the low amount of jobs available from replacement by AI systems. Moreover, people’s daily lives will drastically change when AI becomes a large part of society.  Ultimately, artificial agents will become a large part of humanity and potentially replace it (Dirican 570 - 571).
			</p>
			<p>
			With such a sheer amount of serious danger, it is clear that regulation is necessary. However, it’s easier said than done. With little information about how artificial intelligence will develop and the different paths it may take, there isn’t enough information available to devise an effective means by which to approach the problem. Bostrom proposes to create “correct epistemological standards” and “correct decision theory” which would guide an artificially intelligent being’s actions. However, even Bostrom notes that there are issues with this approach. The approach only partially fixes the problem. If the “being is radically deluded about the state of the world,” this approach falters. Moreover, as Bostrom has deducted creating even the outline for such an approach has been “proven beyond the capacities of mankind” (Thorn 288).
			</p>
			<p>
			Despite the lack of information available there are different ways that humanity can think about approaching the problem. In the case of nuclear, fissile material was secured, and thus, the development of nuclear weapons regulated by governments. One possible, temporary solution could be restricting the availability of the machines capable of artificial intelligence. Although this approach will become obsolete as technology advances, it provides a window of time for researchers to develop a more robust plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Stuart Russell suggests that regulation is in the hands of the developer and researcher. Russell suggests that students of AI be trained in a way such that the “alignment of AI systems with human objectives is central to the field” (Russell and Bohannon). Russell notes that “no one in civil engineering talks about ‘building bridges that don’t fall down.’ They just call it ‘building bridges.’” In the same way the talks about AI should be simply “building AI” instead of “building AI that is probably beneficial” (Russell and Bohannon). However, Russell recognizes that “we don’t know how to write such regulation,” and thus, more research into the subject needs to be done (Russell and Bohannon).
			</p>
			<p>
			Artificial intelligence has the potential to drastically change the world. AI systems have enormous benefits, however, they also bring with them dire consequences. Beyond humanity’s dependency on AI and eventual enfeeblement, improper use of the technology can replace and extinct all of humanity. The process will be gradual, but if humanity starts taking proactive measures too late the state of the world may reach a point of no return. There is no telling what’s too early and from what point to start; thus, the earlier that research and discussion into the matter begins, the less risk humanity takes. Ultimately, its far better to find a solution to a problem that we don’t yet have than to start scrambling for one when time is running against us.

			<em>Preventing the End of the World and the Rise of the Machines</em>
			<p style="font-size:21px;margin-bottom:5px;">Project Overview</p>
			<p>Artificial intelligence development is accelerating at an exponential rate. A system by which future developers of artificially intelligent machines can create and develop safe technology is a necessity. With such a powerful and influential technology preemptive measures must be taken before we start creating it. At the core of an artificially intelligent machine must lie a robust and appropriate code of ethics, such that regardless of the task given to it our society’s values are upheld and ranked higher in priority than the task itself.</p>
			<p style="font-size:21px;margin-bottom:5px;">Goals</p>
			<p>The goal of the research is to produce a robust, effective, and complete system for developers to follow in order to be able to create safe artificially intelligent machines. The resulting framework may not be a tangible product, but it will be something that will lead us into the right direction towards safer technology.</p>
			<p style="font-size:21px;margin-bottom:5px;">Intellectual Merit</p>
			<p>Developing this system will bring artificial intelligence one step closer to fruition. There is no way to make an artificially intelligent machine before having a framework for its developers to follow. Every developer will need to develop a system by which the machines they develop can effectively understand the balance between the optimization of the machine’s respective task and the resources it must use to accomplish it. With this research such a system will already exist saving many years of development, testing, and implementation.</p>
			<p style="font-size:21px;margin-bottom:5px;">Broader Impact</p>
			<p>The system will impact the global community. This system can potentially be the base for a future framework that will be used for creating technology for years to come. As the technology evolves and becomes widely adopted this framework will implicitly affect every user extending to potentially the entire world.</p>
			<p style="font-size:21px;margin-bottom:5px;">Framework</p>
			<p>The framework will be built either as an API for artificially intelligent systems to use to ensure safe computing, or as a programming language of its own. As an API system, it will hook into every action of an artificially intelligent machine, and the implementation of the particular logic of a program will be left as a task to the developers. Implemented as a language, by the virtue of the syntax and semantics of it, unethical computing will be a violation of the language’s rules and standards. The assistance of philosophers and experts in ethics would be critical in understanding how such a system could work. Ethicists and researchers like John Danaher and computer scientists like Stuart Russell can be highly influential figures in producing this system.</p>

				<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;">ETHICS FRAMEWORK FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RELEASED FOR LICENSING</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;">Is There Hope That Artificial Intelligence Will Be Safe?</p>

				<p>LONDON (November 15, 2015)–Google DeepMind finished the development of an ethics framework for building artificially intelligent machines, and will be licensing it on a per year basis. The framework will allow developers to build robust AI (artificial intelligence) systems with fully integrated ethics code, intelligent decision theory, effective optimization, and extensibility.</p>

				<p>After a research proposal for an ethics framework was released in January of last year, Google DeepMind began working on its own framework that would provide a standard for AI development. DeepMind made it their mission to create a system that could integrate an ethical code with the already well established ideas produced by decision theory and operations research.</p>

				<p>Google DeepMind collaborated with computer scientist Stuart Russell, and ethicist John Danaher to uncover the method for linking intelligence, computing, and ethics. Russel is known for his extensive warnings about the dangers of Artificial intelligence, and has been quoted saying, “the first step towards safe and effective artificial intelligence is an ethically sound decision theory.” According to Russel and Danaher, the challenges with building artificially intelligent machines are in trying to find the perfect balance between ethics and efficiency. Over-optimization can lead to unethical behavior, and overly strict ethics can lead to poor performance.</p>

				<p>Founders of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, created the company with the hope that one day it could solve intelligence. Their goal was to combine machine learning and neuroscience to build learning algorithms. “I always dreamed that one day a machine can understand human behavior,” Hassabis said during an interview. Hassabis and Suleyman noted that today machines can only understand predicable outcomes and the understanding of uncertainty is still far from possible, but an ethics framework is bringing machines one step closer to a comprehension.</p>

				<p>Google DeepMind is a British artificial intelligence company founded in 2010 by Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman as DeepMind Technologies. In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Technologies renaming it to Google DeepMind.</p>

			<em>Modelling Trade Durations</em>
			<p>Worked on implementing a Markov-switching multifractal duration model for being able to accurately represent durations in between trades. The model was tested on different dates for various stocks, such as GOOG and CITI with various volatilities in price and trade frequency. The model was assessed for accuracy using 6 different distributions, exponential, gamma, inverse gaussian, log-normal, inverse gamma, and weibull. The gamma distribution was found to produce the most accurate results for modeling durations. Some graphs plotting the simulation data against the sample data and the predicted values against the simulation using different initial parameters can be found below.</p>

			<em>iOS Application (Snapchat Competitor)</em>
			<p>Worked on product design, implementation, and development for an iOS application that would serve as one of the first competitors to Snapchat. The application combined aspects of Snapchat and Instagram to create a hybrid that would give users the ability to combine their favorite features from the two applications into one. I worked on implementing some of the basic screens, functionality, animations, and image filtering and editing. A flowchart of the user workflow can be seen below. <a href="http://nyplus.kevinflyangolts.com">Click here</a> to see the live application.</p>
